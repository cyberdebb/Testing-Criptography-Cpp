# Testing-Cryptography-Cpp

This repository contains experiments and study-oriented implementations related to **cryptography concepts in C++**.

## Purpose
The main objective of this repository is to support learning and experimentation with **basic cryptographic techniques**, focusing on understanding encryption and decryption mechanisms, data transformation, and algorithm behavior.

## Technologies
- **C++**

## Repository Contents
The repository includes:
- Experimental implementations of cryptographic algorithms
- Table-based and substitution cipher approaches
- Code examples developed for educational purposes

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberdebb/Testing-Cryptography-cpp.git
   ```
2. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler of your choice.
3. Run and modify the examples to explore cryptographic concepts.

## Notes
- This repository is intended for educational and experimental use only.
- The implemented algorithms are not suitable for production or secure applications.
